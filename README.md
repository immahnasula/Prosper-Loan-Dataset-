# Loan Dataset from Prosper
## by Halima Nasula Merenga


## Dataset

> The Loan Dataset is from Prosper, a lending marketplace in the United States, and contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, Monthly Loan Payment, borrower rate, current loan status, borrower income etc.


## Summary of Findings

>In the exploration, I found that Borrower APR  and BorrowerRate are inversely proportional to credit score . A higher credit score qualifies you for the lowest interest rates. There is a small but significant positive correlation between DebtToIncome Ratio and BorrowAPR. The lower the DTI ratio, the lower the BorrowerAPR. Borrower Rate is higher for Long Term loans and shortest in short term loans. Typically, the longer the loan term, the higher the interest rate will be (but not always). That’s because shorter terms guarantee the lender will have their money back sooner, so there’s less risk. Employment status duration is inversely proportional to the BorrowerRate. Loan Lenders may look at your employment duration to determine if you are a high risk. DTI Ratio is directly proportional to Borrower Rate. A lower debt to income ratio is likely to have a lower borrowerRate. From Pearson's  correlation coefficient, We can see that there is a strong positive correlation between BorrowerAPR and BorrowerRate, Lender Yield and Borrower Rate and Monthly Loan Payment and Loan Original Amount . Across all credit score groups, the Long term loans have the highest BorrowerRate  while the BorrowerRate is lowest in each credit score group when the loan term is short. Across most loan status groups, the loan original amount is highest for long term loans and lowest for short term loans meaning , someone who takes a large loan amount will need more time to pay it back as compared to someone who has a small loan amount who will need a shorter time to pay it pack .
